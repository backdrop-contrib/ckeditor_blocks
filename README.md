# CKeditor Blocks

A module that enables embedding drupal blocks in CKEditor. It currently uses the 
insert_block module to render the blocks but this functionality may be moved 
into the module to reduce dependencies.

Please, offer feedback and ideas in the issue queue.

Pull Requests are welcome.

## Status

Under development.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

This module works best when used with a text format that does not include the following filters
* Limit allowed HTML tags
* Convert line breaks into HTML (i.e. <br> and <p>)
